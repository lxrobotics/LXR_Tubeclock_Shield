# Description

A Tube Clock is defined as a clock showing the time on a so-called Vacuum Fluorescent Display (VFD). The exact operation of VFDs is described on Wikipedia vividly. The VFDs were developed in the 1960s in Japan and replaced the Nixie tubes which were functioning based on glow lamps principle. Today VFDs, because of their retro looks, are primarily used by hobbyists for clocks construction and other electronic projects. The LXRobotics Tubeclock Shield allows, in combination with an Arduino Uno Board, the construction of such tube clock. For the quick start, Arduino libraries are available with sample programs.

**Features**

* Tube voltage adjustable from 30 to 70 V
* I2C-Real Time Clock  (RTC) for clock functionality
* Brightness sensor (LDR =Light Dependent Resistor)
* Temperature sensor (NTC-Thermistor)
* Connections for 2 button/switch
* Connection for external backup baterry for keeping the current time also at power failure (external backup battery is not included in the delivery)
* Exclusively screw terminals for simple yet stable connection of cables to the board available
* Arduino Library available for control of Tubeclock Shield with example programms
* Arduino Library available for the usage of Tubeclock Shield with a IV-18 Tube
* Arduino Library for conversion of the temperature sensor - tube data in Â°C
